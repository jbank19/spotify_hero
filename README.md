This repo contains all of my files for the final MY472 assignemnt for 2023/24.

The assignment itself is in the SID34947_MY472_assignment4.Rmd  and SID34947_MY472_assignment4.html files.

spotify_albums.RData is a data files that stores some data from Spotify's api that is used in the assignment. The code that creates this dataset takes a while to execute (over 15 minutes), so I have commented out that code, saved the data it outputs, and loaded it back into the Rmd file for convenience. Remove the comments if you want to test that code  (see lines 407-450 in the Rmd file).

table1 contains a table of regression outputs used in the assignment. It is already displayed in the assignment html file (SID34947_MY472_assignment4.html), so you can safely ignore this file (creating it was necessary to work around a bug in the formatting of the table).
